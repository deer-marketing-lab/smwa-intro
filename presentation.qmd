## Class Structure

* **In person**, no recordings

* **Lectures** 
    * Learning methods and doing marketing analytics (together)
    * Discussing academic papers

* **Lab Sections** (*on campus*)
    * Doing and discussing marketing analytics
        * Based on weekly "Lab Assignments"
    * Mix of coding and "theory"
    * Led by student discussion

## Where to Find Stuff

* [**\alertb{Course website}**](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2025-smwa/) is your # 1 resource
  * Canvas only used for group allocation, grades

* **Discussion / Chat**: [\alertb{Slack}](https://tisem-smwa-2025.slack.com/)
  * Group Chat across different 'channels'

* **Email** (if you must): \alertb{tisem.social.media@gmail.com}
  * *Not* our personal email addresses

* **Office Hours**
  * Sign up using [\alertb{links}](https://tisem-digital-marketing.github.io/2025-smwa/home/instructors/)
  * Check the Syllabus for instructions

## Textbooks, Readings

* **No Textbook** for the class
  * Become outdated fast as digital markets and social media change rapidly
  * ... as does taste in methods
  * Some emphasize too much of the hype, remainder are too dry

* **My job**: filter through the sea of information and teach what is useful and relevant
  * No hype, hopefully not too dry

* **Your job**: read over assigned readings, learn the skills
  * I've curated course content to (hopefully) deliver the most insight with the least technical details
  * Coding skills acquired should be easy to transfer to a different problem

* Lecture slides will be on course website as PDFs

## Things to Keep in Mind

* This course is running in a **new(-ish) format** this year
  * With a larger **emphasis on methods** and **doing marketing analytics**
  * There will likely be bugs ...
  * ... We'll work through them together

* **Mix of students** at various **levels**, from various **backgrounds**
  * \alert{Some of the best experiences in class}: learning from others perspectives

# What is Social Media & Web Analytics?

## What is Marketing Analytics?

**Marketing Analytics** is the practice of collecting and analyzing consumer and firm data to optimize a firm's marketing effectiveness and improve business/marketing decisions

* \alert{\textbf{A young field}} with fast progress
    * \alertb{Since the 1970s}: Conjoint Analysis
    * \alertb{Since the 1990s}: Structural Models
    * \alertb{In the last decade}: Rise of Modern Causal Inference, Machine Learning

* \alert{The number of new methods} is increasing fast
* \alert{Most important methods} originate outside the discipline of marketing, 
    * Near the applications, the substance, the problem to be solved 
    * From adjacent fields: economics, statistics, psychology, data science, political science

\alertb{Marketing Analytics is an unusually diverse discipline}, cross-roads of other fields, great place for a broad perspective on methods

## What is the Subfield of *Digital Marketing Analytics*?

* \alert{Digital Marketing Analytics $\leftrightarrow$ Social Media and Web Analytics}
    * Applying **marketing analytics** to the **online world**
        * Websites, Online Advertising, Retail Platforms, Social Media

* Quickly \alert{becoming one of the largest fields within marketing}
    * Lots of data
    * Increasingly the \alertb{main place where consumers and firms interact}


## What is *This* Course About?

**We want to:** 

1. \alert{Understand and use statistics}
    * Using facts you know to learn about facts you don’t know
    * Understand statistical theory underlying specific methods
    * Feel comfortable using these methods in your own work
    * Learn, implement, apply, interpret, and explain methods even *after* the class ends
    * The practical tools of research: theory, applications, simulation, programming — whatever is useful

2. \alert{Learn how to define a topic for research, identifying the big idea, designing a research strategy to answer the question}
    * Biggest factors impacting success: the question and the research design

3. \alertb{Apply these techniques to digital markets and social media platforms}

## Types of Empirical Analysis

**What kind of empirical analysis are of interest to us as marketers?**

* Descriptive Analysis
* Causal Analysis
* Predictive Analysis

## Descriptive Analysis

**Descriptive Analysis**: summarise characteristics of a data set

* What does the data look like?
  * Means, standard deviations distribution of data
  * Results are (stylised) *facts*

Examples:

* How are users who discuss the US election connected on Twitter?
* What topics are discussed on Yelp Reviews? 
* Are discussions on Reddit about Albert Heijn different from those on Twitter?

## Causal Analysis

**Causal Analysis**: Does A lead to B?
 
* Might also care about the mechanism of how it happens

Examples:

* Do Facebook ads increase product purchases?
* Does product adoption by influencers increase demand?
* Do tweets by TV studios increase the number of viewers of their show?

**We'll spend a lot of time in this space**

## Predictive Analysis

**Predictive Analysis**: How can I best predict an outcome?

* When A occurs, so does B

Examples:

* Is this review posted by a real person or by a bot?
* How many retweets does Nike expect its next tweet to get?
* Who is a new Twitter user likely to follow?

**Not the focus of this class**

* Can discuss it in Week 8 if there is the demand ...


## How to do Social Media & Web Analytics

Social Media & Web Analytics needs to combine tools from multiple areas:

1. Statistical / Econometric Methods
2. Text Analytics - 'Text-as-data'
3. Network Analytics
4. Machine Learning

The exact **mix of these** used in any project depends on:

* **The question** you want to answer 
  * Example: Can one deliver valuable insight by ignoring the network structure?
* **Personal taste**

## Course Strategy 

\alert{We could teach you}:

* The latest and greatest methods, but soon after you graduate \alertb{they will be old}
* All the methods that might prove useful for you, but soon after you graduate \alertb{you will be old}

Instead, \alert{\textbf{we teach the fundamentals}}

* Then you can learn new methods invented after class

\alert{Balance of emphasis}: proofs v. concepts & intuition

* Baby Stats: dumbed down proofs, vague intuition
* Math Stats: rigorous mathematical proofs, no data experience
* \alertb{\textbf{Practical Stats}}: math when needed, deep concepts and intuition
    * \alertc{Ultimate Goal}: how to do empirical research, in depth
    * \alertc{Procedure}: Traverse from theoretical foundations to practical application (including "how to do" computations)

## Good and Bad News ...

**Good news**: high quality social media & web analytics is incredibly useful

Why?

* Impacts a wide variety of industries
  * Media & entertainment, politics, health care, FMCG, fashion & beauty, etc
* It provides real answers to real problems in marketing and business strategy
  * And *people care about the answers*

Being able to do (good) social media & web analytics ensures many (enjoyable) job prospects

## Good and Bad News ...

**Bad News**: Its *hard*

* One needs to learn about statistics, text analysis, networks (*and* machine learning) 
* ... **and** be able to work on causal and predictive questions

(That seems like *a lot*...)

* And... learning the tools can be boring

**_Opinion_**: I think the upside far, far outweighs the bad.
